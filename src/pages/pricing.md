        question: Once I start SEO, how long will it take to get rankings?
        answer: SEO isn’t an overnight strategy. The first few months are dedicated to
          making updates to your site and waiting for the search engine spiders
          to crawl and index the changes. Depending on your website, the amount
          of work it requires, and the crawl frequency of the search engine
          spiders, it typically takes 3-9 months to begin seeing new rankings.

        question: How long will it take to see increases in traffic?
        answer: Traffic is typically a direct result of an increase in rankings. Once
          your rankings begin to increase, you will also begin to see gradual
          increases in traffic to your website. Keep in mind that new rankings
          and traffic are not instantaneous, it takes a few months to complete
          the necessary updates and get them indexed before you will begin to
          see these increases.

        question: Why should I continue SEO once I’ve gotten good rankings?
        answer: Achieving the rankings is only half the battle. Since the search engines
          are constantly evolving and updating their algorithms, your rankings
          can fluctuate from one day to the next. Maintaining current rankings
          is just as involved as getting new ones; it takes constant research,
          updates, and testing to keep your URL ranking in the top positions.
          Discontinuing SEO after you’ve achieved rankings will result in a loss
          of rankings fairly quickly.
